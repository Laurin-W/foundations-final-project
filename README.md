**Our motivation**: The fossil industry has been spending efforts to deny climate change and play down environmental issues for decades. A common strategy is to direct attention from colletcive to individual action and to blame individuals for being responsible.

**Objective**: This project tries to find correlations between fossil fuel rent of a country as share of its GDP and the population's awareness of environmental issues. \
In a second step, we try to find correlations between fossil fuel rent and the difference between support for individual versus collective action.

**Data** from world bank and [International Social Survey Programme (ISSP): Environment I-IV](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.14332)

**TL;DR**: We could not find a correlation.


## How to Reproduce the Results?

The code and used data is open source. You can run the [main jupyter notebook](./main_notebook.ipynb) in a single step. For more information on the data's license, see the notebook.

For the notebook VWS notebook, you need to download the data manually, due to license restrictions that prohibit us from publishing it here. The data is openly available though. \
To make it easier for you, you can use the compiled data version instead which is available in this repository. The use of the VWS data was experimental, to see if a different dataset would show differences in the results. Since it did not, we abandoned it in our further research.
