## How to Reproduce the Results?

The code and used data is open source. You can run the [main jupyter notebook](./main_notebook.ipynb) in a single step. For more information on the data's license, see the notebook.

For the notebook VWS notebook, you need to download the data manually, due to license restrictions that prohibit us from publishing it here. The data is openly available though. \
To make it easier for you, you can use the compiled data version instead which is available in this repository.
